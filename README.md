# PreWork Study Guid Webpage

## Description

This is a website created far a bootcamp project, which meant to help me understand basics of FrontEnd programing. It was a good introduction to programing and problem solving excersise where I had to often reach out to difrent sources to understand problems I was facing. Using GitHub to create it was a first big challenge, but with time came understanding. Same for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
